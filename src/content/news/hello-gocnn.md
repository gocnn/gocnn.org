We’re announcing GoCNN as an open-source organization focused on building the Golang AI ecosystem, with a practical emphasis on deep learning tooling and developer experience.

## What is GoCNN?

GoCNN is a community and a set of projects that aim to make AI in Go more usable in real codebases. The Candy framework is one of the flagship efforts, targeting convolutional neural networks and the surrounding workflow (building, training, inference, and integration).

- **Golang-native** - APIs that feel like Go, designed for maintainable systems
- **Ecosystem-oriented** - Not just a library: examples, conventions, and tooling
- **Performance-conscious** - A focus on correctness first, then speed where it matters

## Getting Started

Start with the [documentation](/documentation) and join the discussion on the [community](/community) page.

This is an early public milestone; expect rapid iteration as docs, examples, and project structure solidify.
